Let's assume you have a co-worker explaining a problem to you and you have to
come up with a solution.

Here's your co-worker:

> I have to commute to work every day for two hours. An hour to the office and
> an hour home. The worst part, the train to the office only leaves every hour.
> So if I miss it, I have to wait another hour.
>
> Can you build me a small script for my computer that reminds me that I need
> to leave the office to catch my train? Thanks!

Feel free to ask questions in the comments to solve the challenge.
You can assume that your co-worker has the latest version of Python installed.

If you are not from Berlin, you should know that our transportation system is
called VBB. [They have an API][VBB-API] ;)

The challenge should not take more than two hours,
you do not need to complete it.
